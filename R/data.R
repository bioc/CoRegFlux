#' aliases_SC
#' A data.frame containing the gene ID used in the metabolic model and their
#' common name, used in the gene regulatory network
#' @format a two colums data.frame which first columns correspond to the name
#' used in the model and the second to the ID used in the GRN (common name).
#' Those columns should be named geneName_model and geneName_GRN respectively.
